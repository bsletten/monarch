 * An OperationType is an interface that defines a type of Operation. It

 * Operation in a robust, multithreaded, safe fashion. A class that implements
 * this interface must define a set of attributes for an Operation that allow
 * an OperationEngine to determine the conditions underwhich the Operation can
 * be executed.
